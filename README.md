# Global-Trade-Insights

As a data analyst for a forward-thinking tech company, I conducted a thorough analysis of the global market to identify potential partners for technology trade. This repository showcases my journey through data exploration and visualisation.

## Overview

As a data analyst for a company focused on global technology trade, my objective was to identify optimal markets for high-tech exports and strategic trading partnerships. This repository contains in-depth analysis of global trade patterns, high-tech export trends and the identification of emerging markets for business expansion. I chose to exclusively use Excel for this project to highlight my ability to create pivot tables and graphs whilst also being able to use key functions such as VLOOKUP to perform JOINs. This approach demonstrates my proficiency in using Excel for data processing and analysis in a business context.

The data I analysed was sourced from the World Bank Open Data, spanning from 2019 to 2022. Some of the data contained missing values, which I handled by cleaning and organising the dataset. This was done by removing duplicates, addressing missing values, and normalising the data to ensure it was suitable for analysis. However, it is important to note that due to the missing data, the analysis may not fully capture the complete picture and its accuracy may be limited in some areas. This process showcases my ability to work with raw and unstructured data, emphasising my proficiency in data preparation, which is a crucial step in data analysis.

The project evaluates key economic indicators such as merchandise trade (% of GDP), high-tech exports ($) and import/export volume indexes in order to compare performances across a broad range of countries. The report concludes with business recommendations aimed at expanding into new international markets and limiting risks through a diverse portfolio.

# Summary of Trade Insights

## 2022 Insights
In 2022, the analysis of total high-tech exports across various countries reveals that China stands out as the dominant force in this sector. While China maintains a significant lead in global exports, several other nations also demonstrate strong capabilities that present valuable opportunities for business partnerships. Notably, Hong Kong, Germany and South Korea are heavily involved in high-tech production, making them attractive markets for investment and expansion. Furthermore, Singapore and Vietnam emerge as promising growth opportunities, while emerging markets like Belgium and Vietnam offer potential for early entry into developing tech sectors.

## 2019-2022 Trends
- Between 2019 and 2022, the top performers in merchandise trade and high-tech exports included Hong Kong, China and Singapore, which are considered ideal for tech collaborations. The analysis shows that China, Germany, the US and the Republic of Korea lead in high-tech exports, indicating their potential as key trading partners. Additionally, Vietnam and Malaysia are identified as emerging players in the tech export market, offering cost-effective manufacturing and market expansion opportunities. 
- There is a notable decline in high-tech exports from Hong Kong and China, which may reflect economic adjustments or impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Mexico, Ireland and Vietnam show great promise, as they show strong, consistent import/export volume growth. The data also suggests that diversifying supply chains by partnering with stable economies like Germany, Singapore and Belgium could limit the risks associated with fluctuating market dynamics.
- When it comes to potential prospects for the future, Djibouti, Nauru and Brunei Darussalam import/export volumes are exceedingly high compared to their peer. However, they have limited involvement in high-tech exports, insinuating that they are not involved in the technology sector. Data on high-tech exports was non-existent in some of these countries (Djibouti), therefore it is important that we keep tabs on these countries and conduct further research.

## Visualizations
This project includes a series of pivot tables and graphs designed to visualise key trends and insights in global trade and high-tech exports. Here are snapshots of a few graphs I had made:

Thee Excel worksheet is attached to this repository if you wish to see all the tables, graphs and data.

## Summary
In summary, the company should prioritise high-tech partnerships with established high-tech exporters like China, Germany, Singapore and Vietnam. If we can, we should also include Ireland and Mexico as they show consistent growth in import/export indexes, making them low risk options for long-term investment. We also need to undergo in-depth research in countries with strong trade activity but limited involvement in high-tech exports, such as Djibouti, Nauru and Brunei Darussalam, as these regions can be seen as gateways into new markets. Diversifying market strategy across multiple regions can reduce dependency on a single market and limit risks.

## Future Directions
As global trade continues to evolve, keeping an eye on economic trends, post-pandemic recoveries, and emerging technologies will be crucial for long-term success in the high-tech export sector. Potential areas for future research include:

- Assessing the impact of new trade policies on high-tech exports.
- Investigating untapped markets in regions with growing technological advancements.
